# VacantCourt üéæ

Ever spent way too long trying to find an open tennis court? Yeah, me too. That's why I built **VacantCourt** ‚Äì a straightforward app to help you quickly find available courts nearby, check their status in real-time, and get all the details you need before you head out.

**My goal: Less searching, more playing!**

## üèÅ Getting Started Locally

Want to run this on your own machine? Here‚Äôs the quick guide:

### What You'll Need:

*   Node.js (v16+ is a good bet)
*   npm or yarn
*   A Firebase project (free tier is fine for this)

### Firebase Setup:

1.  Head to the [Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com/), create a new project (or use one you have).
2.  Enable **Firestore Database**. Start in **test mode** for easy dev.
3.  In Project Settings (‚öôÔ∏è), find "Your apps," add a Web app (`</>`), and copy the `firebaseConfig` object.
4.  For address autocomplete, you'll need a **Google Maps API Key** from the [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/). Enable **Maps JavaScript API** & **Places API**, then create and *restrict* your API key.

### Installation:

1.  **Clone:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/sohan-bhat/VacantCourtWebsite.git
    cd VacantCourtWebsite
    ```
2.  **Install Packages:**
    ```bash
    npm install
    # OR
    yarn install
    ```
3.  **Environment Variables (Your Secrets!):**
    *   Create a `.env.local` file in the project root.
    *   Add your keys (see `.env.example` for the structure):
        ```env
        # .env.local (Keep this private!)
        VITE_FIREBASE_API_KEY="YOUR_FIREBASE_API_KEY"
        # ... (all your other Firebase config keys) ...
        VITE_GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY="YOUR_GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY"
        ```
    *   **Important:** `.env.local` should be in your `.gitignore`.

### Run It:

```bash
npm run dev
# OR
yarn dev
